      the people l live/ reside with in person.</P>
      <p style="background-color: white;">At first, l never thourht of any one to ever influence my life and there fore l lived on my one and l was a roll moodel to my own self untill when l came to learn in life that its from those we admire that we take particular steps to success that w need to male each day coz there there are people already in the differrent future that wqe long and hope to be in,
          there fore l decided to formulate my own areas of interest and have different personalities of great influence and therefore, these have really made a great bigup towards my general makeup and actegorically, they can be categorised differently such as the following;

                     he has a good ideological reasoning and on top of that,
                     he has a good following and most of the people have their hopes in him,
                     from him, l know all things are possible just from his own making from scrutch to where he is;
